# Rtv

# Note

Earlier versions of this crate were completely different.
- First `rtv` was a crate for doing **r**ecursive-file-**t**ra**v**ersal
- Then it was a crate for resolving futures easily
Both of these things were pretty useless, which I realized way too late.
I decided to repurpose the name because I don't wanna litter my profile or `crates.io`.
